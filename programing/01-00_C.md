# Seting up C

You can start developing in `C` by choosing a C compiler and a standard library.

## Tools for compile C

**Step 0:** Coosen a C compiler

You need a C Compiler.
The author of this tutorial recommend
[LLVM CLang](https://clang.llvm.org/),
other good compilers are
[gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
or the provided by the processor manufacturer like
[ARM C Compiler](https://developer.arm.com/en/dev2/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Linux),
[Intel C++ Compiler](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html) or
[AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler](https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/).

For example, to install
[CLang](https://clang.llvm.org/) using the `apt` package manager use:

```sh
apt install -y llvm clang
```

**Step 1:** Set the environment variable

`C` compilers tends to use environment variables to find headers and libraries,
to setup these variables to use in `Development Environment`
you need to modify the `env.sh` as follows:

```sh
cat >> "${DEV_HOME}/env.sh" <<EOF
# C
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="\${DEV_HOME}/include:\${C_INCLUDE_PATH}"

EOF
```

## The CC package

You can write a package to wrapper to the system compiler
and standard library.

```sh
mkdir "${DEV_HOME}/.packages/cc"
cd "${DEV_HOME}/.packages/cc"
mkdir bin lib
```

On `bin` you can put a wrapper to your C Compiler (I using CLang)
like as follows.

* `bin/cc`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

CC=clang
ARGC="-W{all,extra,pedantic}"
ARGLD=""

exec ${CC} ${ARGC} $@ ${ARGLD}
```

Make it executable with `chmod +x bin/cc` and add it to
the `Development Envoronment` using

```sh
ls -sf "${DEV_HOME}/.packages/cc/bin/cc" "${DEV_HOME}/bin/cc"
```

These package can be used to cross compilation.

* `bin/armcc`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

CC=clang
ARGC="-W{all,extra,pedantic} --target=arm"
ARGLD="-shared"

exec ${CC} ${ARGC} $@ ${ARGLD}
```

* `bin/x86cc`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

CC=clang
ARGC="-W{all,extra,pedantic} --target=x86"
ARGLD="-shared"

exec ${CC} ${ARGC} $@ ${ARGLD}
```

* `bin/x86-64cc`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

CC=clang
ARGC="-W{all,extra,pedantic} --target=x86-64"
ARGLD="-shared"

exec ${CC} ${ARGC} $@ ${ARGLD}
```
